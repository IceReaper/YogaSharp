# YogaSharp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IceReaper/YogaSharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IceReaper/YogaSharp)

This project is based on the unaltered (except for some paths) Facebook Yoga library https://github.com/facebook/yoga
Goal of this project is to provide an up-to-date nuget package whenever a new Yoga version is released.
I will accept any issue or pull request regarding the build process. If it affects the actual code, it belongs into the official repository!
